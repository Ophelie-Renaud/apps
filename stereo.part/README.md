# Multinode Partitioning with Core Number and Speed Considerations, and Simulated Metric-Based Readjustments for Transfer Cost for Dataflow Actors

The method encompasses three main steps: the distribution of dataflow actors at the node level, followed by their allocation at the thread level based on core speed and quantity, and ultimately the readjustment of the distribution considering transfer time costs.

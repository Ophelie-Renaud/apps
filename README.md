# Purpose
This folder contains projects for the PREESM rapid prototyping tool.
These projects are intended to illustrate the potential of the method developed during my thesis.
The purpose of my thesis is to facilitate the process of static resource allocation (during compilation) for dataflow description applications.

# Project
The PREESM project **"stereo.scape"** illustrate the Scaling up of Clusters of Actors on Processing Element (SCAPE) clustering method and its extensions on the the Stereo image processing application. The method involves adapting the granularity and parallelism of an application on a single homogeneous multicore node reducing the complexity of a dataflow application graph and increasing its performance in terms of throughput.


The PREESM project **"dummy.abc"** illustrate the heterogeneous mulitinode nulticore partitioning method on a dummy application.

The PREESM project **"stereo.part"** illustrate the heterogeneous mulitinode nulticore partitioning method on a dummy application.

# Installation
Prerequisites:

- Install PREESM (see [Getting Preesm](https://preesm.github.io/get/))
- Import PREESM projects (see [Open Tutorial Project](https://preesm.github.io/tutos/intro/)
- Follow **READ.ME** instructions for each project

$Enjoy$
